mongo-to-es-transporter
=======================

## About

This is a docker image, which includes a Compose / Transporter application 
with a predefined, parametric pipeline definition.

The predefined pipeline migrates the current state of a MongoDB database into Elasticsearch,
and then continues with syncing the changes too.
